## Conclusion

The modal was chosen as the last component of this project because, when utilised correctly and at the proper moment, it may be highly beneficial to the user and not an irritating additional hurdle between the user and his search.



This was by far the most challenging and time-consuming component of them all.



It is possible to conclude that, when used appropriately and in accordance with the standards (as was the case), the modal is a great addition to some websites, improving the user experience.
